# Screenshots Directory

This directory contains mobile app screenshots for the Telephoto README.

## How to Add Screenshots

1. Take screenshots from your mobile device (recommended size: 1080x2400 or similar phone aspect ratio)
2. Name them appropriately:
   - `home.png` - Home Screen
   - `gallery.png` - Gallery View
   - `upload.png` - Upload Progress
   - `settings.png` - Settings Screen
   - `sync.png` - Background Sync View
   - `preview.png` - Photo Preview Screen

3. Place the screenshots in this directory

## Image Guidelines

- **Format:** PNG or JPG
- **Dimensions:** Consistent aspect ratio (e.g., 1080x2400, 1080x1920)
- **Size:** Keep file sizes reasonable (< 500KB per image)
- **Content:** Ensure screenshots don't contain sensitive or personal information

## Placeholder Images

Until actual screenshots are added, the README will display broken image links. This is expected and should be replaced with actual app screenshots once available.
